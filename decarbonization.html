        <p>
        <b>Decarbonization </b>refers to the process of reducing or eliminating carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, such as industries, transportation, energy production, and agriculture. The goal of decarbonization is to mitigate climate change by curbing the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which are known to trap heat and contribute to global warming.

        The primary driver of decarbonization is the transition away from fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, towards cleaner and renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. By replacing fossil fuel-based energy with renewable alternatives, we can significantly reduce the carbon footprint and move towards a low-carbon or carbon-neutral economy.

        Decarbonization is a crucial strategy to limit global warming and its associated impacts, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and disruptions to ecosystems. It is an essential component of global efforts to achieve the goals set forth in international agreements like the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

        In addition to transitioning to clean energy sources, decarbonization also involves adopting energy-efficient technologies, promoting sustainable practices in agriculture and forestry, implementing carbon capture and storage technologies, and encouraging behavioral changes to reduce emissions in various sectors of society.
